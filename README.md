# pw_practice
pw_practice - The **bestest** way to learn your passwords.

 1. Create long, random, secure password
 2. Enter password into pw_practice
 3. ???
 4. Profit.

pw_practice will never save your password. Only your current password is in memory as long as the program is open. At least as far as I know.

# Installation

## On Windows:
 1. Download the latest .zip under releases
 2. Extract it somewhere
 3. Run *pw_practice.exe*

## Elsewhere:
Clone the repository and compile it yourself with [Qt](https://www.qt.io/). Maybe I'll do that in the future but I haven't yet.
